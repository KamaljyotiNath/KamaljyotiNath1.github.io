I am Kamaljyoti Nath, a Postdoctoral Research Associate in Applied Mathematics at Brown Universuty from February 2021. I grew up in [Sipajhar, Assam](https://www.google.co.in/maps/place/Sipajhar,+Assam+784145/@26.3973272,91.8896913,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x375afe1ae571ac61:0xaf73ffbabdd75b55!8m2!3d26.4009984!4d91.8952713), where I completed my high school in 2002, stayed at Guwahati for two years, and completed my intermediate from Cotton College, Guwahati, Assam, India. I completed my PhD in 2020 from [Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati (IITG)](https://www.iitg.ac.in/), Assam, India in the Civil Engineering Department (Structural Engineering stream). In Silchar, Assam, India, I received my B.Tech degree in Civil Engineering from National Institute of Technology Silchar (NITS) in the year 2008. From August 2008 to July 2013, I stayed in Bangalore, India, where I worked at TATA Consulting Engineers Ltd.
 
# Research Interest
My broad area of research is in Stochastic Structural Mechanics, Stochastic Finite Element Method (SFEM), Structural Health Monitoring
- Stochastic mechanics
- Polynomial Chaos
- K-L expansion
- Structural Health Monitoring
- Machine Learning

Presence of uncertainties in the system properties of structural system is one of the major concern in the safety of designed structures and often studied using Stochastic Finite Element Method (SFEM). Polynomial Chaos (PC) based method is one of the popular methods for the solution of a stochastic system; however, it suffers the curse of dimensionality which is an exponential increase in the number of terms in the PC expansion with increase in the number of random variables and/or order of expansion. I worked for the development of numerical strategies to address the curse of dimensionality of PC based method in the SFEM framework for the solution of stochastic structural system. Another drawback of PC based method is the loss of optimality in the case of time-dependent problem which can be addressed using time-dependent generalized polynomial chaos (TDgPC) proposed by [Gerritsma et al. (2010)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999110004134). I worked on long duration of response evaluation of stochastic structural system under dynamic loading using TDgPC.

With the increase in importance for monitoring the state of structures, demand for more efficient methods to predict the state of structures are increasing. I am presently working on Machine Learning (ML) based structural health monitoring system.

Future work, I am interested on continueing my study on numerical methods for solution of stochastic system extending to non-linear system along with study on ML and its application.
